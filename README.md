# So we can train a machine learning model â€“especially deep learning model-  with large numbers of x-ray chest images for covid-19 patients and normal people and it can learn how to detect covid-19 patients from the normal people.

# We train a Convolutional neural network or just CNN -a type of deep learning used for image recognition (more correctly "image classification" because it classifies the image into probabilistic classes) - to classify a x-ray chest image to covid-19 patient class or normal person class after extracting the features from the image.
