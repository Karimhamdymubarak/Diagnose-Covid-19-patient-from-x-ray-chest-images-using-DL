## Context
This is a repo for demonstrating how to digonse Covid-19 patients from their x-ray chest images using deep convolutional neural network.

### Genral Idea
The idea comes from we can train a machine learning model â€“ especially deep learning model -  with large numbers of x-ray chest images for covid-19 patients and normal people and it can learn how to differntiate covid-19 patients from the normal people.

### Technical Description

 We train a Convolutional neural network or just CNN -a type of deep learning used for image recognition (more correctly "image classification" because it classifies the image into probabilistic classes) - to classify a x-ray chest image to covid-19 patient class or normal person class after extracting the features from the image.
